        <h2>Professional Statement</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field that requires analytical thinking, problem-solving, and a commitment to continuous learning. As a second-year Computer Engineering student, I am passionate about identifying vulnerabilities, strengthening security systems, and protecting digital assets from cyber threats.

            My strengths lie in network security, penetration testing, and risk analysis, supported by a solid foundation in Python, C, and security principles. I am dedicated to ethical responsibility and staying up to date with the latest security trends to ensure robust cyber defense strategies.
            
            I am actively seeking a cybersecurity internship where I can apply my skills in threat detection, vulnerability assessments, and security implementation. My goal is to contribute to an organization’s cyber resilience while learning from experienced security professionals.
            
            By combining my technical expertise, analytical mindset, and ethical approach, I aim to support cybersecurity teams in protecting organizations against evolving cyber threats. I look forward to opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and make a tangible impact in the field.</p>
